EV Insights Dashboard ðŸš—âš¡

I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to explore Electric Vehicle (EV) market trends.
The project looks at factors like manufacturer, price, battery, range, sales, and emissions to understand adoption, cost efficiency, and sustainability.

#What I Did

Cleaned and prepared the dataset in Power Query
Built relationships between fact and dimension tables
Created DAX measures (Cost per KM, Revenue, Avg Running Cost)
Designed visuals: sales by manufacturer, range trends, battery type distribution, sales by country, and detailed EV stats

#What Youâ€™ll Find

Key Insights â†’ Revenue, adoption trends, running cost efficiency
Interactive Dashboards â†’ Compare EVs by price, range
